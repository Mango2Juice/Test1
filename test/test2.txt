I'm trying to create a script where if I file exists then perform a delete and then get a wget from artifactory. Running this code below for some reason will not delete my file and creates a new one with an extension ...example cageo.crt.1 , .2, .3, etc.

When I try to debug it will show rm -f but without the file name
